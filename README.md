### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I have built an application for providing meal ideas. This takes a user input and displays a random meal choice.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Go to my github page. Clone down the program and then cmd open index.html.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)



### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I worked on this on and off for 5 days. I would esimate it took around 15 hours. I am in mod1.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

To build an application ground up. Creating our own HTML, CSS and JS files.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

I got the functionality to work quite easily. I worked through the needs in pseudocode and implemented them without many issues. 

I struggled with the CSS styling. I need to do more exercises with it. I feel I have a much better understanding but it will take practice.
